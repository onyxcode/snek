# Snek, it used to be a Discord bot
I am keeping this for portfolio purposes.
discord-py has been deprecated in favor of Pycord and this bot most likely will not run.

*If you wish to make changes please create a PR instead of changing the main repo.*

## Instructions
In creds.json, add your Discord bot token and MongoDB URI.
